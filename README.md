# Goalnator

Goalnator provides on weekly basis football betting predictions HI (Human intelligence) based

### Architecture

In this MVP version Goalnator will:

1. Do some web scraping to get the most recent football stats based on the championships listed in src/config/web-scraping-config.json
2. Apply the "Short prediction" algorithm that i will explain separately (TBD)
3. Send emails with predictions on weekly basics. This should be implemented separately using for example the [event bridge scheduler](https://aws.amazon.com/it/blogs/compute/introducing-amazon-eventbridge-scheduler/)

### How to run the code locally
